map shader

1:
    separate draw calls for each layer
    shader just has texture for that layer
    can probably use the same shader for each layer
        draw water
        draw dirt
        draw veg
        draw rock
        draw fungus
    
    write depth using parallax shader to get correct heights

2:
    one shader that draws everything
    uses heightmap to switch
    lots of looping
        draw water
        draw terrain
